# KakuroHelper

## Overview

[Kakuro](https://www.kakuros.com/) is a numerical puzzle game, and is a mix of a crossword puzzle and sudoku. The object of the game is to fill in the empty spaces with the corresponding numbers. Only numbers 1-9 can be used, and a number cannot be repeated in the same row or column. All the numbers in each row/column must add up to the number at the end. This program shows users all possible combinations that can add to a given sum with the provided spaces.

I was inspired to complete this project from the death of flash. There was a flash based kakuro game on [Cool Math Games](https://www.coolmathgames.com/) that would provide this information whenever a player would hover over the chosen number. This game was unplayable after the death of flash and all other kakuro games did not come with this feature. In order to assist the players of kakuro, I've created this program to mimic the accessibility of the previously mentioned version.

This was my first independent C# project and it gave me experience with recursion, lists, GUIs, and debugging.

## Features

This program comes with an interactable GUI that allows the program to run indefinitely to receive multiple different inputs. The "Total" box is for the sum of the row/column and the "Spaces Available" box is for the amount of spaces in the row/column. Then, the "Output!" button will display all possible results.
